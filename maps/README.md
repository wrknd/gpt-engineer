To create a Next.js application, we will need several files and directories. Here's a list of the core files and directories we will need:

1. `package.json`: This file will contain the metadata of our project and the dependencies we will need.

2. `pages/`: This directory will contain all our pages. Each file corresponds to a route based on its name.

3. `pages/index.js`: This is the entry point of our application. It will render the home page.

4. `pages/about.js`: This page will render the about page.

5. `components/`: This directory will contain all our React components.

6. `components/Header.js`: This component will render the header of our application.

7. `components/Footer.js`: This component will render the footer of our application.

8. `styles/`: This directory will contain all our styles.

9. `styles/global.css`: This file will contain the global styles of our application.

10. `next.config.js`: This file will contain the configuration of our Next.js application.

Let's start with the `package.json` file:
